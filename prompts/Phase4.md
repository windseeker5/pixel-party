Implement the core functionality:

1. Big screen display route that shows uploaded photos
2. Text overlay system for birthday wishes (following PRD specifications)
3. Music search functionality using my preserved indexing script
4. HTMX polling for real-time updates on the big screen
5. Basic slideshow with photo rotation

Test that photos upload, display on big screen, and music search works with the existing indexed database.
