Based on the PRD database schema, create:

1. SQLite database setup with all required tables (guests, photos, music_queue, music_library, settings)
2. Basic Flask app.py with routes structure
3. Database models and initialization
4. Integration of my existing music indexing script into the new structure

Make sure the music indexing functionality is preserved and works with the new Flask database schema.
