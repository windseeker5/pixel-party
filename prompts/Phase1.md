I'm pivoting my birthday party app from Reflex to Flask + HTMX + daisyUI based on my PRD document. Please:

1. Analyze my current project structure and identify what to keep
2. Create a clean Flask project structure following the PRD specifications
3. Preserve my existing music indexing script (it's the only working part)
4. Set up the basic Flask app structure with proper imports and configuration

Start by showing me the proposed new file structure and what files from my current project should be preserved or migrated.
